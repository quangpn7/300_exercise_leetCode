## About me
- My name is **_Nhut Quang Phan_**. At the time I created this repository, I has been a front-end learner for almost 6 months.

- After doing some challenge  on LeetCode (_JavaScript_). I decided to created this repo to store my solutions. In the other hand, I think it would be greatful if any of those can help you to find out which you need.

- My solutions may be not optimized or sometimes occur wrong answear. I hope you can share your opinion, other solution to help me figure it out.

- Last word, I hope you all who reading this have a great time, happiness.
## About `main.js`
- I store my code in order of **(EASY->MEDIUM->HARD)**
- All of the excersise will be only in 1 file. This will make your code less performance than seperate each one into one file.
- a `main.js` also is divided each exercise by `#region` and `#endregion` with the standard format as follow:
  ```
  #region ex_1
  ...
  #endregion ex_1
  ```
- At the end of every exercise, I commeneted the `console.log(funcion(...))` in order to avoid the console logging lots of line. In case you want to see how it runs, just simpy remove the comment `//` at the start of that line code.
- To fast navigate to specific excercise, you can <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (_Windows_) or  <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd> (_macOS_) and type in the excercise **title** or **number** of it.
- It would be more useful if you install Quokka extension, which visualize instantly the result, data on the **IDE** (VsCode tested). But I don't recommend to use it for debugging process because every browser (FireFox, Edge, Chrome,...) do it more effective.
## About this `README.md`
- I see this README as my welcome to all of you. In the bellow section, it will be my daily diary about this project. I keep it update which exercises that I have done along with date.
- In the end of the diary line, it it will be a bracket "(total)". Which indicates the total exercises I have done so far at that day.
